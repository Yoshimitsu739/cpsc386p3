Project 3 Simple New Video Game
Team Name: The Cure
Team Member Names :Armando Osegueda, Antonio de Lis, Hector Bernal, Tianzheng Li

Intro: This final project is to write a program for a new simple non-trivial video game of your own choosing. The game must be a well conceived and implemented game that aims to be challenging and engaging for the target audience.


CONTENT FILES: README.txt, sketch.js, index.html, style.css, p5.js, p5.play .
               Assets: Bunny_standing.gif, background.png, bronze_tile_walkway.png, EnemyL.gif,     EnemyR.gif, tranqdart.png, FredLW.gif, FredRW.gif, Shooting_.gif, fredSL.gif.

External Requirements: Node.js or a live server to see the assets. 

Setup and Installation: Download the zip folder from our GitHub link and extract the files onto your computer. If using Atom, install the Atom-live-server package. 

Sample Invocation:?

Features: The game itself is called "Eradication Man". It has the main character, Army Dr.Fred. You control the character by using the left and right directional buttons and then use the space button to jump and the x button to shoot (shooting collisions issues, so not implemented). The NPC, bunny, runs aways as they do not know who you are and the visible virus comes at you.
